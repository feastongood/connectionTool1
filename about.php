<p><strong>Whats going on here?</strong><br/>
This is the second prototype for a project currently named The Feast Connection Tool. We've brought together over 20 inspiring individuals around the work of Gita Nandan and New York Rising. Each week, Gita posts an update of the goings on at New York Rising. These updates are sent out to the community, who have an opportunity to contribute their knowledge and networks to help New York Rising succeed.</p>

<p>The contributors to this prototype all dined together at The Feast NYC's Adapt dinner, hosted at Meatball Shop on May 21st. This test will run until June 18th, 2014.</p>

<p><strong>About The Feast</strong><br/>
The Feast connects creatives, entrepreneurs and influencers around doing good. By gathering these communities in participatory events, we spark cross-disciplinary partnerships, relationships and collaborations that have lasting social impact.</p>

<p><strong>About The Tool</strong><br/>
<p>We're building a digital platform to help connect people in our community to the projects they've discovered through our events. The tool will provide a place where they can follow and contribute to the conversations around a projects long after a particular Feast event is over. </p>

<p>Our goal is to empower all members of The Feast community to share their knowledge, skills, and networks with the extraordinary projects and companies that are working to make the world a better place. For the entrepreneurs among us, our goal is to create a space of continued support, access to resources, and continued engagement with those invested in the their work. </p>
