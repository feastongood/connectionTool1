<p>Hi <span style="text-transform: capitalize;">{FNAME}!</span></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’re ready for The Feast Connects. </p>

<p>We’re putting on the finishing touches, and will let you know when it’s live mid-August. In the meantime, check out <a href="http://connect.feastongood.com">our prototype</a> to get an idea of what to expect on The Feast Connects.</p>

 As a project owner, we'll prompt you to send in an update every other week. This will let your supporters and community know what you’ve been up to and how they can help. Each update will be displayed on your organization's page and emailed to people following your project. If you'd like to see an example, check out the 3 organizations on <a href="http://connect.feastongood.com">our prototype</a>.

<p>We can’t wait to see what a community of like-minded thinkers and doers can achieve when they put their insights and networks together.</p>

<p>We'll be in touch!
The Feast</p>

<p>ps. Have questions? Hit reply, or email <a href="mailto:tash@feastongood.com">tash@feastongood.com</a>.</p>
