    <p>Had some amazing conversations, space, and insight on how we can offer value and look to our community to support and grow The Feast organically. This is super exciting as we figure out how to move away from a sponsorship model. Also came up with some fantastic generative community processes and actions.</p>

    <h5>Rocks</h5>
    <p>Not enough time/ resources till October!</p>

    <p> Funding for awesome stuff vs. just doing awesome stuff without quite enough resources (we are just doing it of course w/ the understanding the everything will fall into place :) </p>

    <p>Several back to back serendipitous talks about a new way to do content that finally gets the systems map that is my brain out in a useful way for the world. Also starting to curate in a super solid thread around the idea of progression from self out to world throughout the conference.</p>

    <h5>Rocks</h5>
    <p>Still trying to figure out the best way to facilitate mass collaboration in a way the lets attendees lead the dialogue while still curating useful and inspiring content/curatorial boundaries.  Also trying to figure out what's necessary vs. unnecessary to facilitate. </p>
