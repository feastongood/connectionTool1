    <p>Huge thanks to Chris Chavez for holding space for me. He facilitated a great trip upstate which gave my brain the space to put a bunch of pieces together very quickly in a way that staring at the problem never could.</p>

    <p>Also lined up a workshop which lead to an exciting new model for The Feast based on participant support, strengthening community engagement and work on the ground. I really believe this evolution of the model will really turn this into the kind of  movement I know is possible. Also decided that our “fault-line” (Occupy’s is the 1%, Burning Man’s is the burning man) is Abundance. Thanks to Miko Matsumaru and Mischa Byruck for that one.  </p>

    <h5>Rocks</h5>
    <p>Building momentum and signing partners on board for the current year while we transition into a fully attendee supported system. We’re shifting but still need to rely on sponsors this year (I think) and they have been challenging to reach, come by, or close. Trying to figure out what value we can offer to more people to offset this need - or maybe I just need to pick up and get on the phone with people!

  <p>What partners do you think would appreciate our work enough to support it in a longer term fashion? <br/>What is the greatest value that The Feast can offer (aside from the conference) that you think people would pay for?</p>

    <p>Several back to back serendipitous talks about a new way to do content that finally gets the systems map that is my brain out in a useful way for the world. Also starting to curate in a super solid thread around the idea of progression from self out to world throughout the conference.</p>

    <h5>Rocks</h5>
    <p>Still trying to figure out the best way to facilitate mass collaboration in a way the lets attendees lead the dialogue while still curating useful and inspiring content/curatorial boundaries.  Also trying to figure out what's necessary vs. unnecessary to facilitate. </p>
