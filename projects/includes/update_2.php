    <p>Several back to back serendipitous talks about a new way to do content that finally gets the systems map that is my brain out in a useful way for the world. Also starting to curate in a super solid thread around the idea of progression from self out to world throughout the conference.</p>

    <p>Still trying to figure out the best way to facilitate mass collaboration in a way the lets attendees lead the dialogue while still curating useful and inspiring content/curatorial boundaries.  Also trying to figure out what's necessary vs. unnecessary to facilitate. </p>
