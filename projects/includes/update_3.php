                    <p>The work on the backend is nearly complete! There were a few bumps along the way, but I'm pretty happy with the work.

                    <p>Finding focus! Coastermatic is my side job right now, and I've found I'm easily excited about new projects. Sadly, since there isn't much time, said projects never properly come to fruition.

                    <p>Went on a proper vacation for the first time in 2 years, and had a great time with no internet for 7 days. Had a chance to do some big picture thinking and reading, which was amazing.

                  <p>To compliment my background as a product designer, I'm thinking about finding a new co-founder with a marketing, sales, or biz devvy background. <br/>Does anyone have any people I should meet, or events I could hang out at to meet awesome people like this?</p>

                    <p>We're redeveloping the code for order processing, and it's almost done! This project solves a bottle neck in order processing that's been hanging around since we started.

                    <p>I want to expand! And it's hard!<br/>
Next, I'd like to approach office spaces with the current Coastermatic offering, so they can help their employees personalize their spaces. The hard part is finding time to put together a pitch deck, and to find the contacts to reach out to.
