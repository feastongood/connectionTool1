                    <p>We're redeveloping the code for order processing, and it's almost done! This project solves a bottle neck in order processing that's been hanging around since we started.

                    <h5>Rocks</h5>
                    <p>I want to expand! And it's hard!<br/>
Next, I'd like to approach office spaces with the current Coastermatic offering, so they can help their employees personalize their spaces. The hard part is finding time to put together a pitch deck, and to find the contacts to reach out to.
