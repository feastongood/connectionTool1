                    <h5>Wins</h5>
                    <p>At 2.3 million text messages exchanged, Crisis Text Line is already the largest text line in the country.  Initial quality data from our pilot remote volunteer program-- where volunteer counselors can be screened, trained, and managed remotely so they can work late night shifts from home-- has just come in, and it's been tremendous, with volunteers already performing at the level of traditional counselors after just 1 month on the job.  </p>

                    <h5>Rocks</h5>
                    <p>We've thus far been funded by an amazing group philanthropic funders who believed in the idea for Crisis Text Line and wanted to turn the idea into a reality. Now that we're moving from proof of concept / beta phase, we need to figure out our growth plan and what funding streams would be a good fit.
